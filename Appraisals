#Once you've configured the appraisals you want to use,
#you need to install the dependencies for each appraisal:
#rake appraisal:install'

#This will resolve, install, and lock the dependencies for that appraisal using bundler.
#Once you have your dependencies setup, you can run any rake task in a single appraisal:
#rake appraisal:rails2 test

#This will run your "test" rake task using the dependencies configured for Rails 2.
#You can also run each appraisal in turn:
#rake appraisal test
